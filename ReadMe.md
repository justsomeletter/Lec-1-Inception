## 3.What is CDN? Why Do we use it?

It stands for Content Delivery Network, it's basically a service that accelerates internet content delivery. A good short (video)[https://youtu.be/Bsq5cKkS33I]by IBM. Main benefit it makes website faster. Servers are not all around the world but users are. So how to facilitate it. It reduces the distance between the content providing server and the user by caching a local copy of the static data. Why static content? Coz it doesn't change very frequently.

## 4.Why is react known as react?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was developed and open-sourced by Facebook in 2013. It is known as React because it was designed to help developers "react" to changes in the state of an application, by efficiently rendering and updating the UI in response to those changes.

React is designed to be declarative, meaning that developers specify what the UI should look like based on the current state of the application, and React takes care of updating the UI as needed. This allows developers to focus on building the logic of the application rather than worrying about how to update the UI efficiently.
